This is a web app with integrated voice assistant in it created by using Alan AI , React.js and Material UI.
Its a news web app which delivers different categories of news to the users as per their voice command.

As the title suggests , this project is based on AI integrated into a web-app. Alan is the perfect companion to your morning cup of coffee, when you’re too lazy to go up the web and scroll for some latest news. Alan is just a click away and can be directly controlled through your voice. He patiently listens to your queries and tries his best to fulfill all your demands. For instance, if you want some news on a particular category , Alan will fetch the news for you and also ask if you want it to be read out loud by him. He can fetch news from different sources all around the world and you can also target a specific term , For example – “Hey Alan , give me the latest news on PlayStation 5” and Alan would fetch it and display it to you. If you want Alan to open a certain news card for you (redirects you to the news source) just say, “Open number 3” or just “Open 3” , Alan is pretty dynamic which allows the users to be free with him and it also doesn’t bound Alan to just a few set of commands.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
